# Read this before reporting a bug

## This is probably not the right place to report a bug

This GitHub repository is *not* where development of ITSx takes place. **Please visit https://microbiology.se/software/itsx/ to find the authors of ITSx, ask questions, or get the canonical software distribution**

This repository exists to disclose NCBI's small modifications of the ITSx program, which mostly have to do with error handling.
